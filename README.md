## Help Navigating the Application

This section explains the different resume components and how they interact with data sources. Each component is responsible for fetching and rendering resume data in various formats.

| **Name**               | **Data Source**                          | **Parse/Fetch Location** | **Render Type**       | **Notes**                                  |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `APIClientResume`      | API endpoint (`/api/resume-data`)        | Client                   | Dynamic client render | Uses fetch on the client after load.       |
| `APIServerResume`      | API endpoint (`/api/resume-data`)        | Server                   | Dynamic server render | Fetched server-side, hydrated client-side. |
| `JSONLocalResume`      | Static JSON file (`/public/resume.json`) | Client                   | Dynamic client render | Fetches local public file client-side.     |
| `MarkdownClientResume` | Static Markdown (`/public/resume.md`)    | Client                   | Dynamic client render | Fetch + `remark` on the client.            |
| `MarkdownServerResume` | Markdown file (`/app/data/resume.md`)    | Server                   | Dynamic server render | Read file + `remark` server-side.          |
| `MDXServerResume`      | MDX file (`/app/data/resume.mdx`)        | Server                   | Dynamic server render | Read + compile MDX server-side.            |
| `MDXStaticResume`      | Hardcoded MDX string (in code)           | Server                   | Static server render  | Static JSX output via `next-mdx-remote`.   |
| `TextStaticResume`     | Hardcoded text content (in code)         | Server                   | Static server render  | No MD/MDX parsing, just JSX sections.      |

### How This Helps
