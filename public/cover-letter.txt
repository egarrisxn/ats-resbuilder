WURL, LLC.


Dear Wurl Hiring Manager, 

I’m thrilled to apply for the Support Engineer position at Wurl! The opportunity to combine my technical skills, customer-focused mindset, and passion for emerging technology with a
company that’s reshaping how we experience TV feels like the perfect match.

In my career, I’ve always enjoyed the challenge of solving problems and creating meaningful connections, whether that’s troubleshooting a technical issue or collaborating with a team to deliver great results. As a freelance developer, I’ve designed and built responsive, accessible
web applications that meet real client needs, often navigating complex challenges to ensure everything runs smoothly. My operational background in account management and team leadership equipped me with strong communication, time management, and customer
resolution skills—traits essential for the fast-paced, customer-first environment Wurl fosters.

While I’m expanding my expertise in digital video delivery workflows, I have practical
experience with JSON, XML, and basic knowledge of formats like HLS and MPEG-TS. Additionally, I’ve assisted in the video editing and content creation processes for a
professional streamer, deepening my understanding of video workflows. My familiarity with
tools for issue tracking, project management, and version control, combined with my
adaptability and eagerness to learn, ensures I can quickly grasp Wurl’s systems, like
Zendesk and Jira.

Your emphasis on mentorship and collaboration align with my values. I’m inspired by the opportunity to work alongside the industry’s brightest minds and contribute to a team
redefining the TV experience. I am confident that my technical acumen, customer-first
mindset, and enthusiasm for technology position me as a strong candidate for this role.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ethan Garrison
