Epic Games Hiring Team
Cary, North Carolina


Dear Epic Games Hiring Team,

My name is Ethan Garrison, and I’m excited to apply for the Web Engineer position on the Epic Games Services team. As a freelance developer with experience building responsive and scalable web applications using React, TypeScript, and Node.js, I’m eager to bring my technical skills and passion for innovation to one of the leading names in gaming and technology.

I greatly admire Epic’s commitment to delivering fast, reliable, and accessible applications that impact millions of users worldwide. The opportunity to contribute to the Epic Games Store and other transformative projects inspires me to take on new challenges and expand my career in web development.

As you’ll see in my resume, I have a strong background in designing and implementing solutions independently. My work has focused on performance optimization, API integration, and database management, with a priority on user experience. I consistently seek to refine my process, using tools like Jest for testing and CI/CD pipelines to ensure efficient and high-quality development. I’m confident these skills align with the needs of the Web Engineer role and your innovative team.

I’ve attached my resume for your review, which highlights more details about my experience, skills, and education. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need any additional information. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Epic Games’ mission and would welcome the chance to discuss how I can support your team’s success.

Best regards,
Ethan Garrison
