Twitch Hiring Team
San Francisco, CA

Dear Twitch Hiring Team,

My name is Ethan Garrison, and I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer I position on the Video Platform team at Twitch. As a freelance developer who specializes in building responsive and scalable applications using Node.js, TypeScript, and React, I am eager to apply my expertise in building robust, performant services to the core systems that power the world’s biggest live streaming service.

I greatly admire Twitch's dedication to continuously improving the viewer and creator experience. The opportunity to contribute to the Video Platform team, which is critical for delivering the best possible video experience, is an exciting challenge that aligns perfectly with my drive to solve complex, high-impact problems.

My experience aligns well with the requirements for this role, particularly the emphasis on back-end development. My previous work has given me a proven ability with data modeling, schema design, and API integration. While working independently, I have consistently focused on performance optimization and database management within my solutions. My skills in Node.js provide a strong foundation for building and maintaining the services required for your platform, and my familiarity with languages like TypeScript and React complements the team's existing technology stack.

As an engineer, I am a strong believer in contributing positively to engineering culture through effective collaboration and attention to detail. I leverage tools like Jest for testing and CI/CD pipelines to ensure efficient, high-quality deployments, and I am prepared to partner effectively with Product Managers and Technical Program Managers. My ability to handle complex systems architecture and my focus on scalability and reliability would be an immediate asset to the Video Platform team.

I have attached my resume for your review, which provides more details about my experience, skills, and education. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my proficiency in algorithms, data structures, and core software development can contribute to the success of Twitch's essential video delivery systems.

Best regards,
Ethan Garrison
